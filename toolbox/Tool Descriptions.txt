WTG_Tools
-Summary
	A suite of tools to quickly filter sets of animal locations.
	NOTE:
	1) If you haven't already, you will need to create a new File Geodatabase (GDB) in a suitable local folder.
	2) You then need to assign it as your "Current Workspace" before using the filter tools. Geoprocessing>Environments>Workspace

	Type filter
	-Summary
		Choose from available location types. 
	-Usage
		NOTE:
		1) The default selections are "Tag Deployed", "Biopsy Sample" and "Argos Pass". Use caution when you're filtering ADB tags!
		2) Most "Tag Deployed" locations are also "Biopsy Sample" as they are simultaneous events in the field; If you uncheck "Biopsy Sample" while "Tag Deployed" is checked, ONLY the samples that were collected post-deployment will be filtered.
	-Syntax

		-Explanation
			You may use the dropdown to choose a <p_> feature Layer from the map TOC, or use the browse button to choose a feature Class from the GDB.
		Type box
		-Explanation		
			Checked types will be preserved, UN-checked types will be filtered.
		newFields
		-Explanation
			By default, tools will output a new filtered <p_> feature class as well as a <_log> with the locations that were filtered. 
			Check this box if you prefer to have the filter output include all of the input locations, with filter info appended to new "Filter Name" and "Filter Parameters" columns. 
			You must type [filtername = 'OK'] into the Definition Query box of the new <p_> Layer before you will see your edits.
